On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

I used the command git log to get 8 commits

The README was last updated Wed Oct 23 16:51:13 2024
I used git log README.md to get this information

Branches are used to insulate the main branch from any changes that may stop it 
from functioning correctly until the branches are ready to be integrated
Branches are also used to collaborate with other people and by merging multiple branches
multiple people have worked on a complete project can be assembled

git status shows if the remote branch is updated with the contents of the repository
and git log shows the details of all commits

I would use git log --follow Vehicle.h

I would use git log --grep "file"

Inheritance is the concept of a child inheriting 
the attributes and methods of the parent object
Polymorphism allows for the parent objec to be implemented in many ways 
via child objects overriding parent methods 
Encapsulation is the concept of combining methods and attributes into 1 object called a class

The main difference between dicator and lieutenants vs integration manager is that
in integration manager version all developers get their own repository but in 
dictator and lieutenants developers push to lieutenant repositories
then those changes can be merged into the dictator and pushed to the blessed repository

A large team of 100 developers would benefit from dictator and lieutenant workflow because 
with a large team in a centralized workflow there may be many situations where someone is
working on a feature and then the main is updated and there will be a conflict when trying to push
the new feature onto main
